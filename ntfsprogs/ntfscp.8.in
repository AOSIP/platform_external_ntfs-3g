.TH NTFSCP 8 "October 2005" "ntfsprogs version @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
ntfscp \- overwrite file on an NTFS volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ntfscp [" options "] device source_file destination"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntfscp
will overwrite file on an NTFS volume. At present
.B ntfscp
can't create new files.
.B destination
can be either file or directory. In case if
.B destination
is directory specified by name then
.B source_file
is copied into this directory, in case if
.B destination
is directory and specified by inode number then unnamed data attribute is created for this inode and
.B source_file
is copied into it (WARNING: it's unusual to have unnamed data streams in the directories, think twice before specifying directory by inode number). 
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B ntfscp
accepts.  All options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by
.BR \-
and the long name is preceded by
.BR \-\- .
Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
single command, e.g.
.BR \-fv
is equivalent to
.BR "\-f \-v" .
Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-attribute " number
Write to this attribute.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-inode
Treat
.I destination
as inode number.
.TP
.BI "\-N, \-\-attr-name " name
Write to attribute with this name.
.TP
.B -n, --no-action
Use this option to make a test run before doing the real copy operation.
Volume will be opened read-only and no write will be done.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-force
This will override some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted
volume.  Use this option with caution.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show the version number, copyright and license
.BR ntfscp .
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Display more debug/warning/error messages.
.SH DATA STREAMS
All data on NTFS is stored in streams, which can have names. A file can have more than one data streams, but exactly one must have no name. The size of a file is the size of its unnamed data stream. Usually when you don't specify stream name you are access to unnamed data stream. If you want access to named data stream you need to add ":stream_name" to the filename. For example: by opening "some.mp3:artist" you will open stream "artist" in "some.mp3". But windows usually prevent you from accessing to named data streams, so you need to use some program like FAR or utils from cygwin to access named data streams.
.SH EXAMPLES
Copy new_boot.ini from /home/user as boot.ini to the root of an /dev/hda1 NTFS volume:
.RS
.sp
.B ntfscp /dev/hda1 /home/user/new_boot.ini boot.ini
.sp
.RE
Copy myfile to C:\\some\\path\\myfile:stream (assume that /dev/hda1 letter in windows is C):
.RS
.sp
.B ntfscp -N stream /dev/hda1 myfile /some/path
.SH BUGS

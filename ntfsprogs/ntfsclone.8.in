.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntfsclone
will efficiently clone (copy, save, backup, restore) an NTFS filesystem to a 
sparse file, image, device (partition) or standard output. 
It works at disk sector level and
copies only the used data. Unused disk space becomes zero (cloning to 
sparse file), encoded with control codes (saving in special image format),
left unchanged (cloning to a disk/partition) or 
filled with zeros (cloning to standard output).

.B ntfsclone
can be useful to make backups, an exact snapshot of an NTFS filesystem
and restore it later on, or for developers to test NTFS read/write
functionality, troubleshot/investigate users' issues using the clone
without the risk of destroying the original filesystem.

The clone, if not using the special image format, is an exact copy of the original
NTFS filesystem from sector to sector thus it can be also mounted
just like the original NTFS filesystem.
For example if you clone to a file and the kernel has loopback device and
NTFS support then the file can be mounted as
.RS
.sp
.B   mount \-t ntfs \-o loop ntfsclone.img /mnt/ntfsclone
.SH SPARSE FILES
A file is sparse if it has unallocated blocks (holes). The reported size of such 
files are always higher than the disk space consumed by them.
The
.BR du
command can tell the real disk space used by a sparse file.
The holes are always read as zeros. All major Linux filesystem like,
ext2, ext3, reiserfs, Reiser4, JFS and XFS, supports
sparse files but for example the ISO 9600 CD-ROM filesystem doesn't.
.SH HANDLING LARGE SPARSE FILES
As of today Linux provides inadequate support for managing (tar, 
cp, gzip, gunzip, bzip2, bunzip2, cat, etc) large sparse files. 
The only main Linux filesystem
having support for efficient sparse file handling is XFS by the 
XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX 
.BR ioctl\fR.
However none of the common utilities supports it.
This means when you tar, cp, gzip, bzip2, etc a large sparse file 
they will always read the entire file, even if you use the "sparse support" 
options. 

.BR bzip2 
compresses large sparse files much better than 
.BR gzip 
but it does so 
also much slower. Moreover neither of them handles large sparse
files efficiently during uncompression from disk space usage point 
of view. 

At present the most efficient way, both speed and space-wise, to
compress and uncompress large sparse files by common tools 
is using 
.BR tar 
with the options 
.B \-S 
(handle sparse files "efficiently") and
.B \-j 
(filter the archive through bzip2). Altough
.BR tar
still reads and analyses the entire file, it doesn't pass on the
large data blocks having only zeros to filters and it also avoids
writing large amount of zeros to the disk needlessly. But since
.BR tar
can't create an archive from the standard input, you can't do this
in-place by just reading 
.BR ntfsclone
standard output.
.SH THE SPECIAL IMAGE FORMAT
It's also possible, actually it's recommended, to save an NTFS filesystem 
to a special image format. 
Instead of representing unallocated blocks as holes, they are
encoded using control codes. Thus, the image saves space without
requiring sparse file support. The image format is ideal for streaming
filesystem images over the network and similar, and can be used as a
replacement for Ghost or Partition Image if it is combined with other
tools. The downside is that you can't mount the image directly, you
need to restore it first.

To save an image using the special image format, use the
.B \-s
or the
.B \-\-save\-image
option. To restore an image, use the
.B \-r
or the
.B \-\-restore\-image
option. Note that you can restore images from standard input by
using '\-' as the 
.I source
file.
.SH METADATA-ONLY CLONING
One of the features of
.BR ntfsclone
is that, it can also save only the NTFS metadata using the option
.B \-m
or
.B \-\-metadata
and the clone still will be
mountable. In this case all non-metadata file content will be lost and
reading them back will result always zeros.

The metadata-only image can be compressed very
well, usually to not more than 1-3 MB thus it's relatively easy to transfer
for investigation, troubleshooting.

In this mode of ntfsclone,
.B NONE 
of the user's data is saved, including the resident user's data
embedded into metadata. All is filled with zeros.
Moreover all the file timestamps, deleted and unused spaces inside
the metadata are filled with zeros. Thus this mode is inappropriate
for example for forensic analyses.

Please note, filenames are not wiped out. They might contain
sensitive information, so think twice before sending such an
image to anybody.
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B ntfsclone
accepts.  All options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by
.BR \-
and the long name is preceded by
.BR \-\- .
Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
single command, e.g.
.BR \-fm
is equivalent to
.BR "\-f \-m" .
.TP
.BI "\-o, \-\-output " FILE
Clone NTFS to the non-existent 
.I FILE\fR. If 
.I FILE 
is '-' then clone to the 
standard output.
.TP
.BI "\-O, \-\-overwrite " FILE
Clone NTFS to 
.I FILE\fR, overwriting if exists.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-metadata
Clone 
.B ONLY METADATA
(for NTFS experts). Moreover only cloning to a file is allowed.
You can't metadata-only clone to a device, image or standard output.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-save\-image
Save to the special image format.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-restore\-image
Restore from the special image format specified by
.I source\fR.
If the
.I source
is '\-' then the image is read from the standard input.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-force
Forces ntfsclone to proceed if the filesystem is marked 
"dirty" for consistency check.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
This program has no known bugs. If you think you have found one then 
please send an email to
.nh
<linux-ntfs-dev@lists.sourceforge.net>.

Sometimes it might appear ntfsclone froze if the clone is on ReiserFS 
and even CTRL-C won't stop it. This is not a bug in ntfsclone, however
it's due to ReiserFS being extremely inefficient creating large 
sparse files and not handling signals during this operation. This
ReiserFS problem was improved in kernel 2.4.22.
XFS, JFS and ext3 don't have this problem.

INTRODUCTION
============

The ntfs-3g driver is an open source, freely available read/write NTFS
driver, which provides safe and fast handling of the Windows XP, Windows 
Server 2003, Windows 2000 and Windows Vista filesystems. Almost the full 
POSIX filesystem functionality is supported, the major exceptions are 
changing the file ownerships and the access rights.

The purpose of the project is to develop, continuously quality test and
support a trustable, featureful and high performance solution for hardware
platforms and operating systems whose users need to reliably interoperate
with NTFS. Besides this practical goal, the project also aims to explore
the limits of the hybrid, kernel/user space filesystem driver approach,
performance, reliability and feature richness per invested effort wise.

The driver is in STABLE status. The test methods, the test suites used and
testimonials can be found on

News, support answers, problem submission instructions, support and discussion 
forums, performance numbers and other information are available on the project

QUICK INSTALLATION
==================
	
Make sure you have the basic Linux development tools and the full FUSE 
package (http://fuse.sourceforge.net) is already installed correctly on 
the computer. Then type:  

	./configure
	make
	make install      # or 'sudo make install' if you aren't root.


USAGE
=====

If there was no error during installation then the NTFS volume can be
read-write mounted for everybody the following way (unmount the volume if 
it was already mounted, and replace /dev/hda1 and /mnt/windows, if needed):

	mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows
or
	ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows

You may also need to set the 'locale' option to make file names with national
characters visible. Replace the below hu_HU.utf8 with the appropriate setting. 

	mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -o locale=hu_HU.utf8

Please see the ntfs-3g manual page for more options and examples.

You can also make NTFS to be mounted during boot by putting the below 
line at the __END__ of the /etc/fstab file:

	/dev/hda1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g defaults 0 0

Linux-NTFS
==========

The Linux-NTFS project aims to bring full support for the NTFS filesystem to
the Linux operating system.

Linux-NTFS currently consists of the NTFS library (libntfs), the NTFS Gnome VFS
module (libntfs-gnomevfs) and various utilities (ntfsprogs).

The Linux-NTFS project is registered on Sourceforge.net. The home page for
Linux-NTFS is http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/ and the project page is:

NTFS library
============

Provides common NTFS access functions to the ntfsprogs and other foreign
open source applications. Note, that the library is still under development and
a lot of functionality is not yet included.

NTFS Gnome VFS module
=====================

The Gnome virtual filesystem provides universal access to diffent filesystems.
This modules enables Gnome VFS clients to seamlessly utilize the NTFS library.
For further details and examples of how to make use of the NTFS Gnome VFS
module in practice see man 8 libntfs-gnomevfs.

NTFS utilities
==============

The ntfsprogs will eventually include utilities for doing all required tasks
to NTFS partitions. In general, just run a utility without any command line
options to display the version number and usage syntax.

The following utilities are so far implemented:

NtfsFix - Attempt to fix an NTFS partition that has been damaged by the Linux
NTFS driver. Note that you should run it every time after you have used the old
Linux NTFS driver to write to an NTFS partition to prevent massive data
corruption from happening when Windows mounts the partition.
IMPORTANT: Run this only *after* unmounting the partition in Linux but *before*
rebooting into Windows NT/2000 or you *will* suffer! - You have been warned!
See man 8 ntfsfix for details.

mkntfs - Format a partition with the NTFS filesystem. See man 8 mkntfs for
command line options.

ntfslabel - Display/change the label of an NTFS partition. See man 8 ntfslabel
for details.

ntfsundelete - Recover deleted files from an NTFS volume. See man 8
ntfsundelete for more details.

ntfsresize - Resize NTFS volumes. See man 8 ntfsresize for details.

ntfsclone - Efficiently create/restore an image of an NTFS partition. See
man 8 ntfsclone for details.

ntfscluster - Locate the owner of any given sector or cluster on an NTFS
partition. See man 8 ntfscluster for details.

ntfsinfo - Show some information about an NTFS partition or one of the files
or directories within it. See man 8 ntfsinfo for details.

ntfsls - List information about files in a directory residing on an NTFS
partition. See man 8 ntfsls for details.

ntfscat - Concatenate files and print their contents on the standard output.

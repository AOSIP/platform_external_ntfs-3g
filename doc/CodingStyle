The standard K&R coding style is used in this project and the guidelines
outlined in the Linux kernel CodingStyle document (found in the Linux kernel
main directory in Documentation/CodingStyle) should be adhered to as strictly
as possible.

Special notes:

	Capitals are used when declaring NTFS on-disk structures which you
	can't just go ahead modifying without getting killed (in a bug sense,
	not literally...). In memory structures are named with lower case as
	usual.

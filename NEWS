ntfsmount can create/delete/move files and directories!  It is not a full
implementation, thus sometimes it will say 'Operation is not supported',
nothing bad will happen to user data in this case.  (Yura Pakhuchiy)

Add new utility: ntfsmount.  It is a FUSE module that uses on libntfs.  So,
you need FUSE 2.3 to compile it.  This module supports file overwrite including
changing the file size and can read/write/add/remove named data streams via
"file:stream" interface and list them via "ntfs.streams.list" extended
attribute (this only if xattr support is enabled).  (Yura Pakhuchiy)

Attribute resize code for normal and sparse files is completed.  Thus, ntfscp
should always successfully overwrite any normal or sparse file even if file
size is changed.  (Yura Pakhuchiy)

Moved back from BitKeeper to CVS on SF.net.

ntfsprogs should now work completely on Windows 2000 and XP (Cygwin). 
mkntfs does not create bootable volumes when on Windows.  Volumes are locked 
when using a R/W utility in order to prevent data corruption.  (Yuval Fledel,
Anton Altaparmakov)

ntfsinfo has been extended and now provides much more detailed information as
well as being able to resolve a path/filename instead of requiring the inode
number.  (Yuval Fledel, Anton Altaparmakov)

mkntfs now creates bootable ntfs volumes so you can install Windows on an
ntfs volume created with mkntfs and Windows will manage to boot afterwards.

ntfsresize now supports relocation which generally means you are now able to
resize to any size you like (as long as there is enough free space).  Note,
this modifies the command line options a little as well as the returned output
so applications using ntfsresize might need modifications before they will
work with the updated ntfsresize.  (Szakacsits Szabolcs)

ntfsprogs now should ./configure and compile cleanly on SuSE as well as RedHat
Linux.

ntfsprogs ("make libs" only) now compiles on FreeBSD, NetBSD, Windows (Cygwin),
and DOS (DJGPP).  Thanks to Christophe Grenier for DOS and FreeBSD testing
and fixes and to Lode Leroy for Windows testing and fixes.

==========

linux-ntfs should now compile and work on all architectures.

Added two options to mkntfs. One to enable compression on the volume and one
to disable content indexing. See man 8 mkntfs for details.

Changed version numbers of mkntfs and ntfsfix to match linux-ntfs release.

ntfsfix had two minor bugs fixed. This also should remove the compilation
warnings in ntfsfix.c on 64-bit-pointer-size architectures.

mkntfs now should be truly bug free.

ntfs_mount syntax changed to accept a read-only flag.

mkntfs now allows creation of small NTFS volumes (current minimum size is one
mega byte). This allows placing NTFS on a floppy disk for example.

mkntfs now correctly handles directories on volumes with large clusters.

ntfsfix now works on Windows XP NTFS volumes (NTFS 3.1).

Reenabled shared library generation and use.

ntfsfix now has a man page, too. Donated by David Martínez Moreno.

mkntfs now uses correct defaults for small partitions on devices with
non-standard sector sizes.

mkntfs now in sbin not bin and it got some bugs fixed.

Gcc 2.96 or above is required to compile.

Dropped ldm, ntfsdump_logfile and dumplog from linux-ntfs distribution. ldm will
reappear in a different package as ldminfo (probably linux-ldm) while the dump
tools are only useful to us developers to play with they don't actually do
anything useful (and these remain in CVS for developer (ab)use).

We now have mkntfs. Yey! And it even has a man page. So go read it. (-8

Disable shared library building by default as it breaks on some systems. (No
idea why. If any one can figure it out and tell me what the problem/fix is I
would be thankful.)

libntfs and hence ntfsfix still don't support attribute lists.

Updated ntfsdump_logfile to really dump the whole logfile with all the current
knowledge about the structures. Also added dumplog which does the same but
operates on a file rather than a partition, i.e. it can operate on a live
mounted NTFS partition under linux when the -o show_sys_files was used on mount.
(Note this mount option first appeared in Linux kernel 2.4.4-ac18.)

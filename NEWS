mkntfs now creates NTFS 3.1 (Windows XP) volumes by default.  The old NTFS 1.2
format is now deprecated and whilst it can still be specified using a command
line option, it will be removed in a future release.

ntfsmount can create/delete/move files and directories!  It is not a full
implementation, thus sometimes it will say 'Operation is not supported',
nothing bad will happen to user data in this case.  (Yura Pakhuchiy)
